* Modify datatypes so that instead of being specified in the definition 
  itself, they are actually subclasses of definition.
  - simplify the writing of new types.
  - no need for datatypes to be plugins in this case
* get rid of IEditable interface and concept.
  - Make itemdefs themselves use the plugin system
  - admin resource can automatically load all itemdefs
  - nothing is stopping you from either reusing itemdefs between similar 
    objects, or using different itemdefs depending on the scenario at hand
