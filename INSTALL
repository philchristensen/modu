Requirements
=============
Python 2.5					http://www.python.org
Twisted >= 9.0				http://www.twistedmatrix.com
MySQL Server >= 5.0			http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html
MySQLdb >= 1.2.3c1			http://sourceforge.net/projects/mysql-python
Cheetah Template >= 2.4.1	http://www.cheetahtemplate.org

Experimental support exists for the PostgreSQL and SQLite databases, as well as
the CherryTemplate and ZPTPages template engines.

Optional:
Apache >= 2.2				http://httpd.apache.org
mod_wsgi >= 3.1				http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi


Installation
=============
The most recent stable version of modu can be installed via easy_install:

	# easy_install modu

This will automatically download ZopeInterfaces, Twisted, MySQLdb, and Cheetah
packages, if necessary.

Nightly releases are available from the modu website, packaged as source
tarballs. To use, download and uncompress the tarball, and execute:

	# python setup.py install

or if you prefer using eggs:

	# python setup.py bdist_egg
	# easy_install dist/modu-X.X_svn_rYYYY-pyZ.Z.egg

Conversely, you may wish to run directly from SVN trunk:

	# svn co http://svn.bubblehouse.org/modu/trunk modu-svn
	# cd modu-svn
	# sudo python setup.py develop


Getting Started
================
If you want to get up and running right away and start looking at a sample
modu project, you can create a stub project with mkmodu:

	$ mkmodu.py mynewproject

Extensive (and continually updated) documentation is available on the modu
website, and specific questions may be asked on the modu developer mailing
list. To sign up, visit:

	http://mail.bubblehouse.org/pipermail/modu-dev


Running Tests
==============
modu is distributed with a number of unit and functional tests that are run
as part of a (currently private) buildbot. To run them on your own machine,
you'll need to configure a MySQL database running on localhost. Once configured,
create the modu test database with the following commands:

	mysql> CREATE DATABASE modu;
	mysql> GRANT ALL ON modu.* to modu@localhost identified by 'modu';

The test scripts will automatically create any table or row data they require.
