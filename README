About WSGI Support
-------------------
Although the modu platform strives to adhere to the WSGI spec for
Python web application frameworks, there are a few places where it
diverges from the standard.

   `environ` Variables of note
   ===========================
   * SCRIPT_NAME - Due to issues with the ModPython/Apache interaction,
     it's not possible to reliably determine the true path to a particular
     directory specified by a URL. As Alias directives and LocationMatch
     directives can create an extremely complex URL trees, this variable
     will be set to the value of config.base_path application variable.
   
   * SCRIPT_FILENAME - The value of this variable is rather vaguely
     defined in the WSGI spec. In modu under ModPython it is set to
     the value of apache.get_handler_root()



Apache Requirements
--------------------
At this time, only Apache 2.2 is supported, and **ONLY** under the
MPM prefork model. This is primarily due to the fact that the MySQL
client library doesn't support threaded requests on a single connection.

Eventually, the goal is to be DB agnostic, or at the very least support
Postgres as well as MySQL.

As to why threads aren't used, I've been warned that doing so tends to
gradually corrupt the Apache memory space over time until it coredumps.
I've yet to verify this on the most recent Apache/ModPython builds,
but figure that avoiding threads is generally a good idea unless
absolutely necessary.
