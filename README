modu is a high-level toolkit for building database-driven web applications in
Python. It provides all the common components needed to build custom web
applications in Python, including form generation, object-relational database
mapping support, pluggable template systems, database-resident session and
user support, and more.

modu encourages a number of conventions intended to keep large-scale web
projects organized and maintainable, while providing a number of optional
services that can be used or ignored by the programmer. It supports
Twisted.Web for deployment of small to medium-sized sites, and Apache 2.2 with
mod_wsgi for high-performance environments, but can be adapted to any
WSGI-compatible container.

modu encourages a lightweight Model-View-Controller approach; if you're an MVC
purist, you'll find your needs met, and if you aren't, you'll find more than
enough rope to hang yourself by.
